## Experience
### **The Knowledge House — Innovation Fellowship, Cybersecurity Track**
**February 2025 – December 2025**
- Completed a rigorous fellowship focused on network security, cloud security (AWS), SOC operations, and incident response.
- Conducted hands-on labs involving OS hardening, Linux administration, secure networking, IAM controls, and SIEM analysis.
- Designed secure AWS environments using multi-VPC setups, IAM least privilege, CloudTrail logging, and GuardDuty threat detection.
- Participated in threat modeling, adversary emulation, and blue-team defensive exercises.
- Competed in Bloomberg Hackathon's **Capture The Flag** event, solving cryptography, forensics, and exploitation challenges.

## Capstone Project
### **Breach Beach — AWS Cloud Cyber Range (2025)**
An interactive, narrative-driven AWS cyber range designed to train users in detecting and responding to cloud security threats.


**Key Features:**
- Multi-VPC infrastructure simulating real cloud attack surfaces.
- Threat detection pipeline using CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Security Hub.
- Red-team attack simulations with matching blue-team response playbooks.
- Automated provisioning using DevOps concepts including IaC and CI/CD workflows.
- Comprehensive documentation, scenario guides, and remediation steps.
